This is the best way to check out my work on. Click the link above and make sure to check out the portfolio link for all my cool project work at RBoot.

Fun fact there's actually two twin sites here, one in bootstrap and one without bootstrap.

You can switch between the sites by clicking on the Responsive, or Bootstrap links on the portfolio page. It's a fun little fact, that had me updating two portfolio's for the entire bootcamp... :D

They came out close, but I like this one... the responsive one better but it was alot more work. /shrug

Enjoy!
